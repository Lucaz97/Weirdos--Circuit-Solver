# Weirdos Circuit Solver
I worked on this project with Niki Di Giano, a friend of mine at Politecnico di Milano.
The goal of this project was to build a simple circuit solver with the intent to undrstand more in depth the mechanics and the general idea behind professional circuit-solving tools such as Spice.
The program is able to solve a circuit with Resistors, Independent Voltage Sources, Independent Current Sources, Controlled Sources (VCCS, VCVS, CCCS, CCVS), Inductors, Capacitors and Quadrupoles. In case of a dynamic circuit it can plot voltage and current of any component on request.

What this project is not about: this project is not about building an efficent circuit solver for professional use. The way we are implementing our circuit solver is not the best one, and we are aware of it. 

There are some example inputs in the repo.

Many thaks to our professor, Federico Bizzari, for his help on this project.
