# Weirdos Circuit Solver
This is an attempt to build a circuit solver, 
I am working on this project with another student at Politecnico di Milano.

So far the program is able to solve a circuit with Resistors, Independent Voltage Sources and Independent Current Sources.
We are working to add Current Controled Voltage Sources and Voltage Controlled Current Sources.
